#  PAC3R Terms of Use
PAC3R is a novel multi-omics research platform facilitates access and collaboration among cancer research organizations. As the first statewide computational cancer research collaboration network, PAC3R, along with its associated bioinformatics platform, will enable Florida cancer researchers to easily access shared resources, driving efficient advancements in cancer treatments to reduce morbidity and mortality among Floridians. Furthermore, the administrative and computational infrastructures of the Florida CARES Network and its PAC3R platform could serve as the foundation for a nationwide collaborative cancer research network, positioning Florida as a leader in innovative, collaborative computational cancer research.
